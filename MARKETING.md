**Subject:** Streakify — habit app that gets kids to actually do their routines

Hi [Name],

I built Streakify, a free habit app designed for families. Kids add daily tasks (brush teeth, read, etc.), complete them to build streaks, and earn gems to build a virtual city. Parents can set rewards for weekly goals and add custom badges.

It's been solving the "get your kid to do their routine" problem for families. Would you be interested in trying it or featuring it?

**Title:** I made a habit app that turns daily tasks into quests — my kids actually do their routines now

**Body:**
I was tired of nagging my kids to brush teeth, make their bed, etc. So I built Streakify.

How it works: they add "quests" (daily tasks), complete them, and earn gems. Gems build a city. There's a GameHub that unlocks when they finish their quests. Parents can set rewards for weekly goals.

It's free, no account needed to start, and works offline. Would love feedback from other parents.
